# SKILL-INTERN-INDIA---TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME-
# Introduction:
Tic tac toe game is a two-player game played on the 3X3 grid between two players. Each player chooses between X and O and the first player starts to draw the X on the space on the grid followed alternatively by the other until a player successfully marks a streak on the grid else if all spaces are filled the game is set to draw.
# Implementation :
In this project, I will build a tic-tac-toe game in Python. I have use the Tkinter tool kit from the Python standard library to create the game’s GUI. Tic-tac-toe game will have an interface that reproduces the classic three-by-three game board. The players will take turns making their moves on a shared device. The game display at the top of the window will show the name of the player who gets to go next.
If a player wins, then the game display will show a winning message with the player’s name or mark (X or O). At the same time, the winning combination of cells will be highlighted on the board.
Finally, it has option to start a new game if anyone wants to play again.
# Conclusion :
The output will like :-
